#Personal Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website created using HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript. I made this project to practice web development and to show my education, skills, and projects as a BCA student. This website helps me understand how a real website is designed and structured.

My name is Rishi Agrawal and I am a first-year BCA (Digital Marketing) student at GLA University. I am learning web development and I enjoy creating simple and responsive web pages. While working on this project, I learned how to use HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for small features like form handling.

The website includes sections such as Home, About Me, Projects, Skills, and Contact. It works well on both mobile and desktop devices. The contact form is a demo form and shows a message when the user submits it. This project is created only for learning and practice purposes.
